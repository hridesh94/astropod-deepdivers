Social media has become a huge part of our everyday life more than ever. These platforms have connected all of us online despite our geographical limitations. The number of hours we spend in our social media feeds are rising day by day with the rising number of platforms and innovation in this space. But do we know how these social media are operating and trying to solve the issues that are inclining? What are these issues? What are the consequences and what are the secrets that big tech companies don't want us to know about? These are the issues we have discussed in this particular episode of “Deep Divers Podcast” along with our own personal experiences and how we got to know about this side of social media.

This is a very raw podcast among two friends who are passionate about having these conversations. Our goal was to keep it just like real life conversations are. This being our very first attempt, I am sure that we will work on the issues that appear here. I hope it puts something of value to its listeners.

Also if you are wondering that the ending is incomplete, it's because we decided to make part 2 on it as it was very lengthy already. So stay tuned for that.
