In our last episode we discussed the darkside of social media and the consequences it can have on various aspects of our life. On this episode of the deep divers podcast, we have tried to discuss the positive impacts that social media have in our society. Our goal with this episode is to portray that things that we take for granted have a big role to play in social media. Also, we have tried to discuss solutions and actions that we can take from our side in order to fight the addiction, mental health issues and other problems that we face through social media usage.
